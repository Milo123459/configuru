# configuru
The `.configuru` directory

# What?

Configuru is a place where my new projects are going to save config files. I have created it to avoid confusion with other projects, and this will also allow for 1 directory over 1 directory for each project.

# Structure

Feel free to use the configuru directory in your app, but the guidelines I would recommend:

- File names should be lowercase
- Extensions should be either `json`, `yml` or `ron` (contribute more if you think they are used enough)
